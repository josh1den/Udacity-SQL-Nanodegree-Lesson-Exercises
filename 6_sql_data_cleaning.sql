### LEFT and RIGHT quizzes
/*

The last three digits specify what type of web address they are using.
Pull these extensions and provide how many of each website type
exist in the accounts table.

There is much debate about how much the name (or even the first letter of a
company name) matters. Use the accounts table to pull the first letter of
each company name to see the distribution of company names that begin with
each letter (or number).

a letter?

### CONCAT, LEFT, RIGHT, and SUBSTR

/*
Suppose the company wants to assess the performance of all the sales
representatives. Each sales representative is assigned to work in a particular
region. To make it easier to understand for the HR team, display the

### CAST queries

data in the dataset called sf_crime_data
*/

### POS, STRPOS

table. Again provide first and last name columns
*/

### CONCAT & STRPOS

primary_poc. The email address should be the first name of the primary_poc .
last name primary_poc @ company name .com.

You may have noticed that in the previous solution some of the company names
include spaces, which will certainly not work in an email address.
See if you can create an email address that will work by removing all of
the spaces in the account name, but otherwise, your solution should be just
as in question 1. Some helpful documentation is here.

after their first log in. The first password will be the first letter of
the primary_poc's first name (lowercase), then the last letter of their
first name (lowercase), the first letter of their last name (lowercase),
the last letter of their last name (lowercase), the number of letters in
their first name, the number of letters in their last name, and then the
name of the company they are working with, all capitalized with no spaces.
